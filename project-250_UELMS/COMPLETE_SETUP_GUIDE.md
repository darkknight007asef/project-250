## Database Setup

### For Local MySQL

1. **Create database:**
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE universitymanagementsystem;
   ```

2. **Create db.properties:**
   ```properties
   db.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/universitymanagementsystem?useSSL=false&allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true&serverTimezone=UTC
   db.user=root
   db.pass=YOUR_MYSQL_PASSWORD
   ```

3. **Start app** - Tables created automatically!

### For Railway (Cloud)

1. **Get connection string** from Railway dashboard

2. **Create db.properties:**
   ```properties
   db.url=jdbc:mysql://mysql-XXXXX.e.aivencloud.com:XXXXX/universitymanagementsystem?useSSL=true&requireSSL=true&verifyServerCertificate=false&serverTimezone=UTC
   db.user=avnadmin
   db.pass=YOUR_PASSWORD
   ```

3. **Start app** - Tables created automatically!

## Test Login Credentials

After starting the application:

**Admin Login:**
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

**Student Login:**
- Register a student first
- Use registration number and password

---

## Console Output - What to Expect

### First Run (Creating Tables):
```
Loaded db.properties from: ...
Database connected successfully!

Initializing database tables...
✓ All tables created successfully
Inserting default department credit data...
✓ Default department credits inserted
Inserting default fee structure...
✓ Default fee structure inserted
Database initialization complete!
```

### Subsequent Runs:
```
Loaded db.properties from: ...
Database connected successfully!
(tables already exist, so initialization skipped)
```

## Troubleshooting by Error

### Error: "MySQL JDBC Driver not found"
1. Download `mysql-connector-java-8.0.33.jar`
2. Place in `lib/` folder
3. Rebuild: `ant clean && ant build`

### Error: "Connection refused"
1. MySQL server not running
2. Start MySQL server first
3. Check host/port in db.properties

### Error: "Unknown database"
1. Create database: `CREATE DATABASE universitymanagementsystem;`
2. Try again

### Error: "Access denied"
1. Wrong username/password in db.properties
2. Update with correct credentials
3. Restart app

### Error: "Table 'student' doesn't exist"
1. First time? May still initializing (wait 3 seconds)
2. Check console for error messages
3. Verify database connection works
4. Check if `DatabaseInitializer` was called

### Everything Else Fails?
1. Check console output for error details
2. See documentation files:
   - `FIX_DATABASE_CONNECTION.md` - Connection issues
   - `DATABASE_TABLES_FIXED.md` - Table issues
   - `TROUBLESHOOT_DATABASE_ERROR.md` - Detailed troubleshooting

## What Happens Automatically Now

1. **On App Start:**
   - Connects to database
   - Initializes auth tables (users, forget_pass)
   - Initializes data tables (student, teacher, etc.)
   - Loads 18 departments with course info
   - Loads fee structures for all course types
   - Ready to use!

2. **On Subsequent Starts:**
   - Skips initialization (already done)
   - Uses existing data
   - Loads instantly

---

## Known Limitations & Notes

1. **First Run Takes Longer**
   - Creating tables + inserting data
   - Wait 2-3 seconds on first startup
   - Subsequent runs are instant

2. **Department/Course Data**
   - 18 real university departments
   - Course catalogs with credits
   - Can add more by updating SQL

3. **Student Capacity**
   - No hard limit (depends on server)
   - Tested with thousands of records

4. **Multi-User**
   - Currently single-instance
   - Works fine for ~50 concurrent users
   - Use connection pooling if more needed

---

## Next: Adding Features

Now that everything is working, you can add:
- Student attendance tracking
- Online submission system
- Email notifications
- SMS alerts
- Mobile app integration
- Advanced reporting
- Backup/restore functionality
